# Axillary Region Models Repository for Electromagnetic Applications #

This repository includes 10 numerical models of axillary regions of 5 patients obtained from breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The purpose of this repository is to provide models to the research community, which can be used for the development and/or validation of new electromagnetic systems for diagnosis or treatment of axillary region or other diseases in the torso, including the diagnosis of Axillary Lymph Nodes (ALNs).

## Repository Structure ##

Each axillary region model includes a maximum of 6 tissue types: adipose tissue, muscle and fibroglandular tissue, skin, lung, healthy ALNs and metastasised ALNs.

## Compatibility ##

All files are provided in MAT, RAW and STL formats. The files were created with the original resolution of the MRI scans. Post-processing steps such as interpolation or smoothing filters might be needed to fit the electromagnetic simulation software requirements. The STL files were not validated for 3D-printing. Two additional files for adipose and skin without cavities are provided in STL format to allow the user to combine post-processing STL files.

## MRI Acquisition ##

- 3.0T clinical system (Magnetom Vida, Siemens Healthineers)
- This study was approved by the Scientific and Ethical Commission of Hospital da Luz Lisboa under the references CES/44/2019/ME and CES/34/2020/ME.
